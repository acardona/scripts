# Transform the image in 2D by using an affine matrix
# The identity transform--or no transform--looks like this:
#
# [1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
#  0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
#
# Above, the first row is the X axis
# and the second row is the Y axis

# The application of this transformation matrix to the coordinates
# of each pixel will do nothing: coordinates stay the same.
# The first two columns control scaling, rotation and shear,
# and the third column controls the translation.
#
# What are these values? A matrix is a way of representing a system of equations.
# In this case, there are two variables: the X and Y coordinates.
# Each cell in the matrix is really:
#
# [[cos(angle), sin(angle), translation],
#  [-sin(angle), cos(angle), translation]]
#
# When the angle is 0, the two cos(angle) are 1.0,
# and the two sin(angle) are 0.0. Which is the identity affine transform.
# 
# Where does this matrix representation come from?
# Turns out, the linear mapping (the transformation) is merely the upper left part:
# 
# [[cos(angle, sin(angle)],
#  [-sin(angle, cos(angle)]]
#
# To include the translation along with the linear map into the same matrix
# would allow for a single matrix multiplication to take place, reducing
# computational costs and simplifyig the representation. This is what
# the affine transform accomplishes, by virtue of being an augmented matrix
# (see wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation#Augmented_matrix ).
# 
# And so the full matrix would look like this:
#
# [[ cos(angle), sin(angle), translation],
#  [-sin(angle), cos(angle), translation],
#  [          0,         0]            1]]
#
# The extra row is all zeroes with a one at the end;
# the extra column is the translation term, plus a 1 at the end.
# 
# This augmented matrix can now be multipled by other similarly augmented matrices;
# in other words, multiple affine transforms can be concatenated and therefore
# compacted into a single affine transform. This presents the enormous
# advantage of then letting us apply a single transform to the image,
# reducing not only the number of operations per pixel (and therefore gaining
# in speed performance) but also reducing the noise, by avoiding the repeated
# transformation (with its floating-point error from interpolations) of the image.
#
#
# Handling angles by using sin and cos, though, is fidgety and error-prone.
# Instead, let's develop an intuitive understanding first,
# and then show how to use existing convenience methods so that
# we never have to use sin and cos in our own code.

# An alternative that works also for 3D transformations exploits

# That is, instead of applying a transform to an image, an then applying
# a second transform to the resulting image, instead the transformation
# matrices can be multiplied, and a single transform applied to the image.
# This is desirable not only for performance reasons, but primarily
# because it avoids the accumulation of interpolation errors.
# In addition, ImgLib2 realtransform classes offer a "rotate" method
# which simplies operations further: no more explicit sin and cos!

# use positive angles to mean clockwise rotations, so we use radians(45)
